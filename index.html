    <h2>Thoreau's map of Mt. Monadnock</h2>

    <p>So wrote Thoreau as part of his Journal entry for August 9, 1860, describing his last visit to Mount Mondadnock in New Hampshire, as seen at left below. In the bound Journal volume, Thoreau's sketch map of the mountain (recto) faces the page of description (verso). Interestingly, the map&mdash;at first glance, anyway&mdash;appears upside-down with respect to the preceding text. It's necessary to rotate the Journal volume 180 degrees to read many of Thoreau's labels on the map.

    <p>Houghton Mifflin's 1906 edition of Thoreau's writings, edited by Bradford Torrey, prints the map rotated so that Thoreau's labels can be easily read. Rotating the map also puts North at the top of the page, where most readers are used to seeing it. But this increase in readability comes at a price. The map's orientation in the Journal manuscript reveals something important about Thoreau's methods and general outlook that the re-oriented map obscures.</p>

    <p>Consider that there would have been no particular reason for Thoreau to rotate his Journal volume before beginning to draw his map. Meanwhile, there is very good reason to believe that he deliberately set out to represent his perspective looking south from the peak, the perspective from which he presumably took the bearings rendered on the map in pencilled lines. <!-- Something here about how Bradford and Torrey render the map with N at top, "right-side up", and that as a result we miss the opportunity to understand how Thoreau went about drawing the map. --> Certainly this is not the only one of Thoreau's maps that reverses the convention of placing North at top. For example, the survey map of Walden Pond that Thoreau included in <em>Walden</em> ("The Pond in Winter") similarly presents us with what looks like an "upside down" pond when compared to what we see on most maps. Thoreau's map of Walden is intended to reflect the view of the pond from his house, which is labeled in the map's lower right corner. (Thoreau also helpfully includes an arrow pointing to "True Meridian.") However, if Thoreau began sketching his Monadnock map from his southward-looking perspective at the peak, at some point in labeling the map, he clearly decided to adopt the conventional "north-up" point of view.</p>
