    <p>So wrote Thoreau as part of his Journal entry for August 9, 1860, describing his last visit to Mount Mondadnock in New Hampshire before his death in 1862. As Laura Dassow Walls explains in <em>Henry David Thoreau: A Life</em> (U Chicago Press, 2017), Thoreau had set out from Concord five days earlier, accompanied by his close friend, "the ever-ready [Ellery] Channing, who had never been camping before, slogging straight through a rainstorm to the very same hollow on Monadnock's summit where he and [H. G. O.] Blake had camped two years before" (469).</p>
    <p>Thoreau had first climbed Mt. Monadnock in 1843, alone. It was, writes Walter Harding in <em>The Days of Henry Thoreau: A Biography</em> (1962; rpt. Princeton UP, 1992), "the first of many visits to what was to become one of his favorite mountains" (171). A crucial difference between Thoreau's final visit and the earlier ones, however, is that by 1860 Thoreau had had the opportunity to read Darwin's <em>Origin of Species</em>, had begun his project of mining his Journal to create a series of phenological tables recording the dates when various natural phenomena had taken place each year, and was now heading to Monadnock determined, as Walls puts it, "to study <em>everything</em>, get the whole big alpine picture in one place" (468&ndash;469). In the Journal, his notes on this visit "go on for more than twenty-five pages: scores of plants, from trees to grasses to lichens; birds, both visiting and resident; mammals (only two, rabbit droppings and porcupine skull); insects, frogs&mdash;and people, of course, and their ways of making the mountain their own<!-- Thoreau mapped the summit, studied the bogs, and decided which rivers drained out of each. He sketched the rocks and descried their glacial grooves, aligned so precisely northwest to southeast they could have steered him in a fog-->" (469). The rows of hallooing young men with their legs dangling over the precipice, the children, the incessant chink of the cold chisels&mdash;all reflect the fact that Monadnock was already a busy tourist destination, as it remains today.</p>

    <p>Thoreau mapped the summit," Walls continues, "studied the bogs, and decided which rivers drained out of each. He sketched the rocks and described their glacial grooves, aligned so precisely northwest to southeast they could have steered him in a fog." In the Journal, the page facing Thoreau's description of Monadnock tourists is entirely taken up by Thoreau's sketch map of the mountain. Thoreau presumably took the bearings recorded on the map while standing on the summit, looking south. But he wouldn't have drawn the map itself, or recorded his other notes, until returning to camp, as it wasn't his practice to take his precious Journal volumes into the field; instead, he jotted down information in a small notebook and later worked these up into Journal entries.</p>
    <p><!-- Something here about how T took his measurements - casting rocks, etc. -  and the assertion that this is no hasty sketch map but a map that reflects his experience and skills as a surveyor. --></p>
    <p>In the bound Journal volume, Thoreau's sketch map of the mountain (recto) faces the page of description (verso). Interestingly, the map&mdash;at first glance, anyway&mdash;appears upside-down with respect to the preceding text. It's necessary to rotate the Journal volume 180 degrees to read many of Thoreau's labels on the map. </p>

    <p>Houghton Mifflin's 1906 edition of Thoreau's writings, edited by Bradford Torrey, understandably prints the map rotated so that Thoreau's labels can be easily read. Rotating the map also puts North at the top of the page, where most readers are used to seeing it. But this increase in readability comes at a price. The map's orientation in the Journal manuscript reveals something important about Thoreau's methods and general outlook that the re-oriented map obscures.</p>

    <p>There would have been no particular reason for Thoreau to rotate his Journal volume before beginning to draw his map. Meanwhile, there is very good reason to believe that he deliberately set out to represent his perspective looking south from the peak, the perspective from which he presumably took the bearings rendered on the map in pencilled lines. <!-- Something here about how Bradford and Torrey render the map with N at top, "right-side up", and that as a result we miss the opportunity to understand how Thoreau went about drawing the map. --> Certainly this is not the only one of Thoreau's maps that reverses the convention of placing North at top. For example, the survey map of Walden Pond that Thoreau included in <em>Walden</em> ("The Pond in Winter") similarly presents us with what looks like an "upside down" pond when compared to what we see on most maps. Thoreau's map of Walden is intended to reflect the view of the pond from his house, which is labeled in the map's lower right corner. (Thoreau also helpfully includes an arrow pointing to "True Meridian.") However, if Thoreau began sketching his Monadnock map from his southward-looking perspective at the peak, at some point in labeling the map, he clearly decided to adopt the conventional "north-up" point of view.</p>
