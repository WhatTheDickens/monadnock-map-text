    <p>So wrote Thoreau as part of his Journal entry for August 9, 1860, describing his last visit to Mount Mondadnock in New Hampshire before his death in 1862. As Laura Dassow Walls explains in <em>Henry David Thoreau: A Life</em> (U Chicago Press, 2017), Thoreau had set out from Concord five days earlier, accompanied by his close friend, "the ever-ready [Ellery] Channing, who had never been camping before, slogging straight through a rainstorm to the very same hollow on Monadnock's summit where he and [H. G. O.] Blake had camped two years before" (469).</p>
    <p>Thoreau had first climbed Mt. Monadnock in 1843, alone. It was, writes Walter Harding in <em>The Days of Henry Thoreau: A Biography</em> (1962; rpt. Princeton UP, 1992), "the first of many visits to what was to become one of his favorite mountains" (171). A crucial difference between Thoreau's final visit and the earlier ones, however, is that by 1860 Thoreau had had the opportunity to read Darwin's <em>Origin of Species</em>, had begun his project of mining his Journal to create a series of phenological tables recording the dates when various natural phenomena had taken place each year, and was now heading to Monadnock determined, as Walls puts it, "to study <em>everything</em>, get the whole big alpine picture in one place" (468&ndash;469). In the Journal, his notes on this visit "go on for more than twenty-five pages: scores of plants, from trees to grasses to lichens; birds, both visiting and resident; mammals (only two, rabbit droppings and porcupine skull); insects, frogs&mdash;and people, of course, and their ways of making the mountain their own<!-- Thoreau mapped the summit, studied the bogs, and decided which rivers drained out of each. He sketched the rocks and descried their glacial grooves, aligned so precisely northwest to southeast they could have steered him in a fog-->" (469). The rows of hallooing young men with their legs dangling over the precipice, the children, the incessant chink of the cold chisels&mdash;all reflect the fact that Monadnock was already a busy tourist destination, as it remains today.</p>

    <p>Thoreau mapped the summit," Walls continues, "studied the bogs, and decided which rivers drained out of each. He sketched the rocks and described their glacial grooves, aligned so precisely northwest to southeast they could have steered him in a fog." In his Journal entry for August 8, he describes taking bearings from the summit: "Walk round the west side of the summit. Bathe in the rocky pool there, collect mountain cranberries on the northwest side, return over the summit, and take the bearings of the different spurs, etc. Return to camp at noon." In his entry for August 9, he explains his ingenious method for taking the measurements he needed for his map: "The basis of my map was the distance from the summit to the second camp, measured very rudely by casting a stone before. Pacing the distance of an easy cast, I found it about ten rods, and thirteen such stone's throws, or one hundred and thirty rods, carried me to the camp. As I had the course, from the summit and from the camp, of the principal points, I could tell the rest nearly enough. It was about fifty rods from the summit to the ravine and eighty more to the camp."</p>
      
    <p>In the Journal, the page facing Thoreau's description of Monadnock tourists (verso) is entirely taken up by Thoreau's map (recto). He would not have drawn the map itself, or recorded any of his other notes, while out and about at the summit, as it was not his practice to take his precious Journal volumes into the field&mdash;instead, he typically jotted down information in a small notebook and later worked these up into Journal entries.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, the map&mdash;at first glance, anyway&mdash;appears upside-down with respect to the preceding text. It's necessary to rotate the Journal volume 180 degrees to read many of Thoreau's labels on the map. </p>

    <p>Houghton Mifflin's 1906 edition of Thoreau's writings, edited by Bradford Torrey, understandably prints the map rotated so that Thoreau's labels can be easily read. Rotating the map also puts North at the top of the page, where most readers are used to seeing it.</p> 

    <div style="margin: auto; width: 85%"><img src="images/bradford-torrey-journal_v20_pp36-37.png"style="width: 100%;"><p style="font-style:italic; font-size: smaller;">Thoreau's Journal. Internet Archive.</p></div>
    <p>But the 1906 edition's increased readability comes at a price. The map's orientation in the Journal manuscript reveals some important things about Thoreau's methods and general outlook that the re-oriented map obscures.</p>

    <p>A moment's reflection makes it clear that there would have been no particular reason for Thoreau to rotate his Journal volume before beginning to draw his map. It is much more likely that he began drawing the mountain from his perspective on the summit, guided by the bearings and measurements he had taken there. It would not have troubled him that this perspective put South at the top of the page. Foregrounding his own perspective was not unusual for Thoreau and in fact entirely consistent with his interest in representing nature in a way that included his own subjectivity as observer. "Wherever I sat, there I might live, and the landscape radiated from me accordingly," he writes in <em>Walden</em> ("Where I Lived, and What I Lived For"), describing how he had previously imagined himself settling in a variety of locations other than the one where he ultimately built his home in the woods. In the chapter "The Pond in Winter", he includes a survey map of the pond that captures his perspective from that home, and like his map of Monadnock it puts South at the top, so that the pond appears
    "upside down" when compared to what we see on most maps. (He helpfully includes theh word "House" at lower right, and an pointing downward to "True Meridian.") <!--However, if Thoreau began sketching his Monadnock map from his southward-looking perspective at the peak, at some point in labeling the map, he clearly decided to adopt the conventional "north-up" point of view. --></p>
