    <h2>Thoreau on Mount Monadnock</h2>
    <p>On August 4, 1860, accompanied by his close friend Ellery Channing, Thoreau set off from Concord on what was to be his final visit to "one of his favorite mountains," as biographer Walter Harding tells us: Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire (Harding, 171). He had made the first of his many visits in 1843, traveling alone. Now, with Channing, "who had never been camping before," he slogged "straight through a rainstorm," writes biographer Laura Dassow Walls, "to the very same hollow on Monadnock's summit where he and [H. G. O.] Blake had camped two years before" (Walls, 469).</p>
    <p>By the time of his final visit, Thoreau was on a quest to understand the unifying principles beneath nature's diversity. He had encountered Darwin's <em>Origin of Species</em>, and he had begun mining his Journal to create a series of phenological tables recording the dates when various natural phenomena in Concord took place each year, sometimes referring to these as his "Kalendar." As Walls explains, he embarked on this last trek up Monadnock with a mission: "to study <em>everything</em>, get the whole big alpine picture in one place" (468&ndash;469). His notes on this visit in the Journal "go on for more than twenty-five pages: scores of plants, from trees to grasses to lichens; birds, both visiting and resident; mammals (only two, rabbit droppings and porcupine skull); insects, frogs&mdash;and people, of course, and their ways of making the mountain their own."</p>
    <p>"Thoreau mapped the summit," Walls continues, "studied the bogs, and decided which rivers drained out of each. He sketched the rocks and described their glacial grooves, aligned so precisely northwest to southeast they could have steered him in a fog" (469). In his Journal entry for August 8, Thoreau describes taking bearings from the summit: "Walk round the west side of the summit. Bathe in the rocky pool there, collect mountain cranberries on the northwest side, return over the summit, and take the bearings of the different spurs, etc. Return to camp at noon." In his entry for August 9, he explains his ingenious method for taking the measurements he needed for his map: "The basis of my map was the distance from the summit to the second camp, measured very rudely by casting a stone before. Pacing the distance of an easy cast, I found it about ten rods, and thirteen such stone's throws, or one hundred and thirty rods, carried me to the camp. As I had the course, from the summit and from the camp, of the principal points, I could tell the rest nearly enough. It was about fifty rods from the summit to the ravine and eighty more to the camp."</p> 
    <p>In the Journal, the page facing Thoreau's description of Monadnock tourists (verso) is entirely taken up by Thoreau's map (recto). He would not have drawn the map itself, or recorded any of his other notes, while out and about at the summit, as it was not his practice to take his precious Journal volumes into the field&mdash;instead, he typically jotted down information in a small notebook and later worked these up into Journal entries.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, the map&mdash;at first glance, anyway&mdash;appears upside-down with respect to the preceding text. It's necessary to rotate the Journal volume 180 degrees to read many of Thoreau's labels on the map.</p>

<p>Here is what Thoreau has to say about the tourists, beginning on the page before the one pictured above, whose first words are, "The young men sat in rows with their legs dangling over the precipice&ndash;"</p>
<div style="color:gray; border-left: 2px solid gray; padding-left: 10px; text-indent: 1.2em;">
  <p style="margin: 0px;">There were a great many visitors to the summit&ndash;both by the S & N (i.e the Jaffrey &
    Dublin paths) but they did not turn off from the beaten track. One noon when I was on the top&ndash;I counted 40 men women & children around me. & more were constantly arriving while other were going. Certainly more than 100 ascended in a day&ndash; When you got within 30 rods you saw them seated in a row along the gray parapets&ndash;like the inhabitants of a castle on a gala day&ndash;& when you behold Monadnock's blue summit 50 miles off in the horizon&ndash;you  may imagine it covered with men women & children in dresses of all colors&ndash;like an observatory on a muster field.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px;">They appeared to be chiefly mechanics & farmers boys & girls from the neighboring towns. The young men sat in rows with their legs dangling over the precipice&ndash;squinting thro' spy glasses&ndash;& shouting & hallooing to each new party that issued from the woods below&ndash;</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px;">Some were playing cards. Others were trying to see their house or their neighbor's. Children were running about & playing as usual. Indeed this peak in pleasant weather is the most trivial place in New England&ndash;there are prob. more arrivals daily than at any of the white mt houses. Several were busily engraving their names on the rock with cold chisels&ndash;whose incessant chink you heard&ndash;& they had but little leisure to look off. The mt was not free of them from sunrise to sunset&ndash;though most of them left about 5 Pm. At almost any hour of the day they were seen wending their way single file in various garb up or down the shelving rocks of the peak&ndash;</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px;">These figures on the summit seen in relief against the sky (from our camp) looked taller than life. I saw some that camped there, by moonlight one night.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0px;">On Sunday, 20 or 30 at least, in addition to the visitors to the peak&ndash;came up to pick blueberries & we heard on all sides the rattling of dishes & their frequent calls to each other.</p>

<p>Monadnock was already a tourist destination in Thoreau's time, as it remains today.</p>

    <h2>An upside-down map?</h2>

    <p>Here's a larger view of Thoreau's map.</p>
    <div style="margin: auto; width: 85%"><img src="https://milnegeneseo.github.io/monadnock-map/images/map.jpg" style="width: 100%;"></div>
    <p>It's not hard to understand why Houghton Mifflin's 1906 edition of Thoreau's writings, edited by Bradford Torrey, prints the map rotated 180 degrees from its orientation in the Journal. Rotating the map puts North at the top of the page, where most readers are used to seeing it. It makes Thoreau's labels easier to read. Indeed, the fact that Thoreau turned the Journal to add these labels suggests that, at some point in drawing it, he decided he wanted it to have a "North-up" orientation. Arguably, reproducing its original orientation would have <em>made</em> it an upside-down map in the 1906 edition's print presentation of the Journal. Thoreau seems to have intended for it to be read with North at the top.</p> 

    <div style="margin: auto; width: 85%"><img src="images/bradford-torrey-journal_v20_pp36-37.png"style="width: 100%;"><p style="font-style:italic; font-size: smaller;">Thoreau's Journal. Internet Archive.</p></div>
    
    <p>But it's unlikely that Thoreau <em>began</em> drawing the map "North-up." He had no particular reason to turn his Journal upside-down before setting pen and pencil to paper. More likely, he began drawing the mountain from his South-facing perspective on the summit, guided by the bearings and measurements he had taken there, which are indicated on the map by the radiating lines in pencil with labels such as "s5w," "S45W," and "N65E." The varying orientation of these labels makes it clear that Thoreau must have rotated the Journal volume repeatedly in adding them. Judging by the hooked ascender of the large capital "N" for North, Thoreau had already decided on a "North-up" orientation for the finished map by the time he added that label. (Compare the capital "N's" in his other labels on the map.)</p>

    <p>The outcome of this process was a map that, viewed with the Journal volume in its normal orientation, showed the landscape as it appeared to Thoreau on the summit, and turned around, showed that same landscape as it would appear on a conventional map. Whether intended or not, this "choose your own perspective" result is certainly consistent with Thoreaus's interest in representing nature so as to include his own subjectivity as observer. As the website "<a href="https://thoreauskalendar.org/about.html">Thoreau's Kalendar</a>" explains, Thoreau's phenology project, which combines meticulous observation of seasonal phenomena with details of "Thoreau's own activities and seasonally-determined behaviors," reflects his dissatisfaction with the detached stance he saw dominating the science of his time. "I think that the man of science makes this mistake, and the mass of mankind along with him," he writes in his Journal entry for November 5, 1857, "that you should coolly give your chief attention to the phenomenon which excites you as something independent on you, and not as it is related to you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With regard to such objects, I find that it is not they themselves (with which the men of science deal) that concern me; the point of interest is somewhere between me and them (i. e. the objects) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>
      
    <p>In <em>Walden</em> ("Where I Lived, and What I Lived For"), Thoreau imagines housing himself in a variety of locations before the one he ultimately selects by the pond. No matter the location, "Wherever I sat, there I might live, and the landscape radiated from me accordingly," he writes, sounding like a modern-day practitioner of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/">phenomenology</a>. In the chapter "The Pond in Winter," he includes a survey map of the pond that captures his perspective from the home he built by a cove on the pond's north shore. Like his map of Monadnock it consequently puts South at the top, so that the pond appears "upside down" when compared to what we see on most maps. (He helpfully includes the word "House" at lower right, and an arrow pointing downward to "True Meridian.") <!--However, if Thoreau began sketching his Monadnock map from his southward-looking perspective at the peak, at some point in labeling the map, he clearly decided to adopt the conventional "north-up" point of view. --></p>

<h2>More than just a sketch</h2>

<p>The sketch-like appearance of Thoreau's map belies its precision. As a skilled surveyor, Thoreau was able to make use of the rough measurements he took of the distance from the summit to his and Channing's second camp and combine these with his accurate bearings of the spurs to produce a remarkably detailed and accurate representation of the mountain. He indicates the map's scale ("80 rods to the inch") at the bottom (when the Journal is rotated to put North at the top.)</p>
